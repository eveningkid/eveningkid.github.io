## Personal Projects

### WoP (2011-2013)

Other screens: [History Mode](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/wop-2.png) / [Multiplayer Waiting room](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/wop-3.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS, PHP**  
> Multiplayer browser game based on the PokÃ©mon universe.

This project  definitely helped me using both JS and PHP, **making them communicate** (first tests using Ajax). I always worked alone on this project, asking for frequent feedback to a few beta players.  
This indie project gathered **more than 500 players** within two weeks. I had to stop it, because of all the time I spent working on it (being around 16 years old).

### Kodder (2014)

[Website Home](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/kodder-5.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS, PHP**
> Local IDE, and learning platform.

Kodder started because **I really wanted to work on a local web IDE**. Back in time, Atom, Brackets,...weren't even released, and I felt that I missed such a free tool. As I really loved using PHP as well as JS, I focused on bringing this platform up using these two languages.
I also added a **learning section**, who'd have helped people to learn how to program. When I realised that a bunch of new profesionnal web IDE had been released, I stopped Kodder's development. Yet, Kodder could be installed and used locally in its last version.

### Mony (2014)

![http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/mony-1.png](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/mony-1.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS, Ionic (AngularJS/Cordova)**  
> Android application, debt manager between friends.

As I learned how to use Ionic for a couple of months, **I decided working on a full application which could help people managing debts between friends**. At my University, this problem came out almost every week: "How much do I owe you again?".  
I then decided working on it. It allowed me to **improve my AngularJS skills, and learning concepts from Material Design**. For now, Mony had been downloaded +200 times and [is available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bustr.mony) both in french and english.

### gCast (2014 - 2015)

![http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/gcast-1.png](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/gcast-1.png)  
Other screens: [Channel Example](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/gcast-2.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS, Meteor, AngularJS**  
> Website helping new casters to find more audience, both on Youtube and Twitch.

This is a project I started as I used Youtube a lot. Twitch was still independant from Amazon, and not that much used as today. I really wanted to **create one single platform where anyone could share his streaming channel and Youtube videos in one place**. This would allow the casters to reach new people.  
It was meant to be categorized by game, including Youtube videos so every viewer could only watch the games he likes.  
The platform had encountered **a great success as hundreds of people were using it daily**. I decided to close it a few months ago, to start working on a better version, more friendly-user and a better as well as faster UI (by mainly using both Meteor and Angular). The new version development is still in progress.

### Why You Shoud Love Star Wars (2015)

![http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/wyslsw-1.png](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/wyslsw-1.png)  
Other screens: [GIF Page](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/wyslsw-2.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS**  
> Open-source project, sharing good reasons to love Star Wars movies.

A really little project, that I built with all my love for Star Wars. I wanted to make something funny, so I thought that using gif would do the trick. You can see it running here: [eveningkid.github.io/whyyoushouldlovestarwars](//eveningkid.github.io/whyyoushouldlovestarwars).

### Kodder2 (2015) 

![http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/kodder2-1.png](http://kodder.fr/portfolio/static/img/kodder2-1.png)

**HTML/CSS, JS, Meteor, ReactJS**  
> Future open-source project, only based on learning with others.

This new version of Kodder mainly aims at **teaching programming with courses and the community help**. I can't give more details as I'm still digging in the idea, but the project is already using Meteor and ReactJS frameworks.
